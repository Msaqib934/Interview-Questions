Q1) What is the difference between the `taint` and `import` commands in Terraform?
Import:

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

import {
  id = "i-0573333333"
  to = aws_instance.example
}

terraform init
# To get hcl code from AWS
terraform plan --generate-config-out=file.tf
# copy code from file.tf paste in place of import block and remove import block then apply below command to get statefile
terraform import aws_instance.example <instance id>
terraform plan
# you will get message "No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration." it means your terrafom code and aws resources are synced.

Taint:
Terraform taint resource.id manually marks the resource as tainted in the state file. So when you run terraform apply the next time, the resource will be destroyed and recreated.
